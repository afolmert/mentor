This is a TODO file for Mentor project.  Currently it includes just draft
random ideas about future Mentor development.

As a first TODO item for this file is make it more managable and readable.
Also convert it to some markup format.

--------------------------------------
DESIGN {{{
--------------------------------------

- make a mindmap
make a mindmap of mentor/probe requirements and design
and gui mockup of mentor
and uml diagrams of mentor to get a general overview first
then go top-down programming -> making stubs for all the procedures and
functions and listing problems to solve --> with comments
solve the problems aside (in special code branch?)
THEN start bottom up -> writing code for the simplest use-cases but in the
described framework


- excel table for class comparison in probe
make excel table with all the class and features they have - how they compare,
how can I generalize them ??!

- many statements do not need an ending statement e.g. when \begin
encounters next \begin then it switches to it automatically without any need
for \end - might note in documentation that it is optional

- must gather community - see about supermemo and flashcard programs ,
advertise mentor on linux/windows software sites , various distros, python and
qt communities and learning communities
also have databases of different items and advertise them .e.g tell people
there is vim knowledge database for SuperMemo and Mentor
BTW Mentor should be able to import from SuperMemo


openoffice, word etc.
- lisp markup - special way to mark hashstrings??
learn them in sm , author many documents in them, convert play with them,
collect info , read community stuff --


- make vim syntax file for the probe language .prb files basing on LaTeX
vim syntax sources.

- all command-line options should be overridable in source -> like verbose mode
and debug ??


- using command to a set of words:
\begin{verbatim}
this is \ignore{craze idea} said adam ~{follow me}
\end{verbatim}


- the special chars like \~ should have their counterparts  \ignore

- options should have default values
   e.g. \lang python  or lang=python

- design the mentor documentation after supermemo and other flash-card program
documentations.

- put mentor design in supermemo / mentor itself for better understanding


- both forms are possibe either:
\begin{verbatim}
\begin{signature}
\signature
and for ending:
\end{signature}
\endsignature
\end{verbatim}


- enable/thisable markup easily
  set unset options
  x

- different variants of column questions
in 3 columns
in 2 columns
sep by TABs , sep by many spaces

- how to exclude
some when i column view
% ^\  exclude\{   }   ^{ }
% This excludes the whole item from column view
\begin{verbatim}
aaaa
^\{bbbb
cccc}
ddddd
eeee
^{ffff}

#{here some task }
\end{verbatim}


- remember I have to design more generally (with full commands and all)
 and enable some features as shortcuts and aliases -> see perl where some stuff
 can be done more and less verbosely
 commands may be abbreviated.

- options may be global in preamble and regarding the whole file
  and local - regarding only some subset of file
  e.g.
\begin{verbatim}
\option{swap}
   ...
or \swap{...}
\end{verbatim}

- breaker class -> make it break by comma instead of / character?
  when i don't want comma then i would need to escape it with backslash
\begin{verbatim}
this is, some text, to be more sure
instead of
this is/ some text/ to be more sure
\end{verbatim}

- what shortcuts to use:
\begin{verbatim}
| |  _ _    for cloze \cloze{
< > ^ ^     for set  \set{}
// //  /  /    for breaker \br{}<++>
,, ,,  ,  ,    for breaker2 \br2{}<++>
$ $            for verbatim code
<- ->   TAB    for tabbed breaks
$$
&&
!! !!  hint in answer
?? ?? hin in question
:: ::
;; ;;
<<   >>
\end{verbatim}
but make them work only in selected region so I don't get many false positives.



- note that it's
\begin{verbatim}
\command[]{ }  and not \command{} []
\end{verbatim}

and \\ is used to break line Like \newline
and \ is used to join (but it must be at the end of line - no whitespace after
it!)



- CLASSES:
  set cloze breaked
  are divided by:
-->   what selects from text:
      all, marked, parts, words, sentences, tabbed
-->  when item is broken
       on enter
       on dot sentence
--> what is ignored
--> what selected
--> how breaked , formatted
--> formatted or verbatim , how formatted
--> how to extract
    ----------- -->
       --> -->
--> what to output:
     e.g.. grapical outputs coordinates


- how to find in document my markup quickly
 -> have a special vim function/command to grep all or to jump to next

 -> have special key to unerline \bs pu underline
 -
--> hints
  hint in question \bs\ ? what are they
  hint in answer  \bs\ ! they are what


--> different classes:
  \bs\ sp break on paragraph
  \bs ss break on sequence
  \bs sa break on all




 Latest from the readme file :

README

My goal is to start writing and using Mentor. Right now the development
is practically halted because too much is on my head.



DESIGN
The basic initial design
Basically it will be a replacement for my SMEX program in Delphi - with
another syntax (xml-based) and helper macros in VIM/Python.


1. Creating data
Data will be stored in XML format and edited in VIM.
I will have python macros which will help me convert raw data into
meaningul items which can be later memorized.


2. Memorization
Memorization will be done in SuperMemo.
Right now I don't have time nor motivation to start coding at full
repetition GUI.

3. Databases
I have to create and use some databases in order to get in full motion.
Then I can think of even more improvements

Home:
Welcome to Mentor

MENTOR is a tool for improving the learning process.


It can be used as a help in learning foreign languages , geography , science and
can be used everywhere, where there is a need to comprehend knowledge and
somehow memorize it and keep it in memory .


knowledge may be split into seperate items which can be memorized.

By learning process is meant extracting knowledge from written material,
processing it to more consumable form and then memorizing it and storing in
memory.

MENTOR helps by providing ways of extracting knowledge (by summarizing ) and
transforming it (emacs macros) to flashcards

Web search (Google , Code search Krugle etc. and others)
Desktop search (Google search, Copernic Desktop Search wide range)
Emacs search -        / Chm search etc.
Memory search

personalized searched with custom areas, files and rules
e.g.
Alt-S-R-P  Search Reference of Python
Alt-S-N-S Search Notes Snippets/Samples

rules like Regexp, Highlight if in filename or in html title
PythonProject

  inherits SnippetsProjects
     add dirs
add files



Files specially prepared
chm -> htm , pdf -> txt rtf -> htm etc.
so that swish-e can find them



In emacs displayed like ctrl l :
% ---c:\Program..\python.py -----------------------------------------
(in text properties may be all)

3 lines before
<b>import os<\b>
print s
etc.
3 lines after

instead of bold , also text properties


going to line and pressing enter , opens the file in second window
the window is of type of which the file is e.g.
python mode
or muse mode
or w3m mode if html window (but better keys handling)

I have 2 windows for browsing files

folmert: Mentor will be completely in Emacs?? 12:28 10:54

 2006-04-26 12:28 folmert: Mentor will be completely in Emacs??
Low-profile, fast supermemo with focus on creating knowledge ??
See how speedreading is working in supermemo


 2006-04-25 18:18 folmert: Probe
probe will be general purpose extracting knowledge tool
extensions to c code, python code etc.
mentor will be for working on the

 2006-04-18 13:31 folmert: Mentor graphics will have several incarnations:
0. in emacs quick testing (this more like text)
1. visio extended - for quick testing
2. supermemo light - a version of supermemo with ability to test my ideas
and quickly draw schemas and import bitmaps
 and schedule for some time
3. in full supermemo session


 2006-04-18 13:01 folmert: With mentor focus on the text side only
use experiences with the german learning process
convert this into mentor/excel/supermemo solution
 (with ability to tweak the fonts in supermemo)
to enable fast edition and reexport on both sides
for graphics, just use visio and supermemo and
write down what improvements could be made to enhance the overall process


 2006-04-18 11:55 folmert: When learning in supermemo, have a database of already exported words
so that I don't learn them twice
mentor -append (only appends the ones which are not there
if a word is already there it is skipped and a message follows)
appending only news one


 2006-04-14 13:46 folmert: Mentor Graphics : at best do it as visio extension
the hidden surfaces might be as second layer - may be initially at bottom and
semitransparent


 2006-04-13 15:12 folmert: Design it as a command-line tool
for import for different type of text
e.g. import columns , import program files (pas, c)
export to supermemo export to mentor/graphics


 2006-03-14 14:28 folmert: Just start doing this
and when doing  think of design for my application : visual and textual
what features might be useful in such an application?

 2005-12-29 11:54 folmert: rewrite Mentor in python , run from emacs as
 command filter , 2 stages - from normal text to xml text, then from xml to sm
 export

 2005-12-29 11:55 folmert: Mentor goal: I give him input and he generates
 supermemo file for learning

 2005-12-29 11:56 folmert: Mentor-Graphics and Mentor-Text


 2006-01-05 21:40 folmert: Learn emacs and other frequently used tools in
 supermemo


 2006-04-12 15:53 folmert: Mentor include a range of tools like:
Mentor/Graphics (for graphic supermemo)
Mentor/Text (for text supermemo)
Mentor/Export (for supermemo export)
Mentor/Probe (for probing in things)

TODO
How to put text in special font (code font?)
Right now put it as \\begin and \\end and later change to something else
how to automatically fill regions
when editing tex/latex files
how to give header page
How to make references to other part of the document??
Is it possible to generate html/xml and chm and man/info pages out of it?
I would like to have only one document for edition but which will generate a
series of documents
Why is the margin so big?
The extract name should be in capitals instead
Check out how python doc is done - how do they generate their documentation??

TODO see how other parsers (XML, HTML) are written
think about it , design generally then write some specific prototype
Learn LaTeX/TeX well before I begin (using old Mentor first maybe??)


{{{1 older stuff



Ad 1. Intro to Mentor
Mentor is an app which should help you learn stuff quickly. I mean all
sorts of stuff - everything that you read but would like to remember for
longer time


Ad 2. Markup language
Mentor markup language
the purpose of markup language is help for generating repetition items quickly.


The purpose
quickly generating lots of items for supermemo

Generally I should be able to just paste cheatsheet
then apply some little/mall markup rules to better transform learning process
There should be as little changes to the original texts as possible - the XML markups just go out of question

I will create cheatsheets and out of this cheatsheets -> just a little command to generate supermemo items as well

The stynax colors should make the additional words not really visible just like ocmments
The idea
The syntax is generally based on TEX/LATEX markups


cheatsheets to supermemo

1. General options
[prefix="ale"]

1. Headers
2. Different classes
I will have different classes for different formatting cases.

*** class QA

options:
 [swap]
 [noswap]
   should the item be swapped ?
   when questioning?
   e.g.
   what is your subject?
   maths

   when swapped this will translate to ->
   q: what is your subject?
   a: math
   and swapped question:
   q: math?
   a: what is your subject

   [TODO] find a better example



*** class CODE

*** class CLOZE
This class describes a typical cloze questions

*** class SET



*** class CODE
options:
  [lang=c/pascal/java/javascript/python]
  etc.
signatures
the code itself as well or not ?



*** class


2. Special directives

\include{file}[name]
this includes a file to the current file

\compounds{file}
This options means to include a file with compounds e.g. item which
always go together and should be treated as such . Generally, all words
with capital letters one by one are treated as compounds.


\ex
\bold \
the text up till end should be bold
??
this will be better with *text*

\item
\enditem
This will mean I want all the text as one item
By default items will be seperated by one blank line
but if I want several pars to be one item , I can put this one

\
at the end of line , this directive will join both lines to one
(just like c preprocessor)


3. Shortcuts aka special chars
There will be a set of special chars which will modify the meaning and
give some clues for extraction purpose.



^   ignored word
this means the word will not be included in repetitions
~  joined words
?   words to be selected

General rule for character ? and ^:
their appearance in text determines whether I should rather exclude or
include words: they are also mutually exclusive - this can be checked as
a test.

Consider these cases:
Poland was raised in ?996.

and
Poland ^was ^raised ^in 996

The first one will ask for 996 only. The second will ask for Poland and
996 as they are not excluded.
By default I ask for all words (unless the \common directive

TODO WRITE DOCUMENTATION IN TEXINFO





the idea is to use as little macros as possible
I just should use the plain text as it is

have very different formats to translate from

y
the basics



Ad 3. Mentor GUI
Mentor GUI is an app written in PyQt.
I really believe this is the optimal choice for quickly writing
applications.











Ad 4.


Other apps which I based myself on are:
* SuperMemo - this is THE program for making repetitions. It is traditionally geared more towards learning language than for any other purpose.
* Mnemosyne - this is an opensource version of SuperMemo , written in
Python and Qt. It is also geared towards word learning and therefore it
is not very suitable for my needs. It certainly was an inspiration
though.

set of macros
mentor minor mode
perparing texts for supermemo and testing for supermemo
extract sentence , and add to database , making it a question

plus
set of shell/python  scripts for
extracting knowledge from pascal, c etc sources
and converting to supermemo knowledge
maybe using emacs snavigator for analyzing source code ??



allowing :
set of macros for preprocessing  a text
extracting extractant information from plsql code for example

e.g.
function name1
function name2
function name3

Also performing gap text test e.g.
blanking out and showing all of given words randomly
or I can mark by myself the words which I want to be tested

create table XMIGPROPS_V32

 performing different tests :
 - q and a test like in supermemo on Q A

Check out elip and flashcard modes


Export to my graphic supermemo testing ground

with objects that will disappear ?? or better bitmap ??
it would be nice to have such access to supermemo that I can export and not
touch it anymore

SuperMemo i innych programów do edycji jednostek
plus wstawianie ró¿nych obrazków

równolegle do tego bêdzie mo¿liwoœæ edycji (?) bezpoœrednio w kodzie czyli w
MenScriptcie (?) bêdzie to coœ w rodzaju xmla + postscript + latex + wmf
np <script wmf> </script>
tak ¿eby mo¿na by³o te¿ wstawiaæ obrazki (i je edytowaæ)

"wizja interfejsu" learning - tool/features or domain/features or product inside (toughest part)
all methods:
automatic mentor learning
map ming creating
debugging, playing with software
plain reading - boring
supermemo
evaluating, comparing, assessing different software/different things
visual learning
motivational
deductive -> inductive thinking
puzzles solving
visualization
reading around - all around
think before read ---> ???
mnemonic techniques
pictures
Visio Together Rose Select
tworzenie dokumentacji
tworzenie tutoriali z rzeczy ktore musze sie nauczyc
learning
automatyczne tworzenie map/czegos ktore moge powtarzac w supermemo
0-wym kosztem
to co sie nie udalo robic recznie ale tak zeby to byla zabawa
reszta to pryszcz
przed robieniem czegoœ odœwie¿enie pamiêci o konkretne mapy -- zastanowienie siê jak to jest zrobione, poczytanie Ÿróde³
przed kazdym czytaniem zastanowic siê co w³aœnie bêdê czyta³/zadaæ jakieœ pytania
narysowaæ mapê
code learning/tool learning
after reading: code refine/design/note improvements while reading
top down learning - first interface then innards
find similar stuff
think on your own - first think then read


TODO
napisaæ Mentora + zdobyæ jak najwiêcej materia³ów (podobnych programów itp), nauczyæ siê


koniecznie Mentora podstawy skoñczyæ ¿eby móc mapy myœli (napisaæ do SuperMemo z nowy adresem)

Mentor
; also as a comment
__ works as _
since, if, as, but, instead, according to, between, over   : should be ignored
no space between options
options for one line only
automatically no swap for ,..,.., items
\\ for line breaking
words in file ignored

Mentor system:
* MenScript
* Mentor.Draw - ObjectPascal library for drawing charts, diagrams etc.
* Mentor.Reading - for detailed and careful reading
* Mentor.Graphics

 LATEST NOTES
.#23 Proper error handling would require writing a full-blown parser instead of using 00:16 ([[2007.10.24#1]])
quick-regexp
will it make probe much slower ??

.#22 Probe: Question marks should be only escaped in | | groups. Otherwise they 20:56 ([[2007.10.23#1]])
should be treated as sentence seperators.

.#21 ----- 18:13 ([[2007.10.19#1]])
The build script should also perform a set of tests after making the build
to make sure the build is correct
all the test suite should be run
---
Chomp all should run git-ls modified to see what where modified and chomp only
them
and only non-binary files

.#19 Bug: 23:20 ([[2007.10.16#3]])
\code1 class break probe
but not \abrakadabra
I think that's because it begins with \code ??

.#18 Corpus: 18:48 ([[2007.10.16#2]])
trim to mostly used words - delete words not used often
extend with internet/technical jargon
pack tables?? compress tables ?

_maybe_  _this would be better_ _than_ _this_

_maybe this_would_be_better[?what][!clue]
 _than[abbrev] _this

Maybe use lightweight markup to achives formatting for questions?

Mentor:
Options  : parsing options and generating options - please take care they are
distinct


Mentor ideas:
ParseClassCommand
 this will be a complex algorithms
  with many options : markers, switches, other functions
    which may be set by subclass if they want to overrid

  in another case it may select to override the whole parse_content function.

class #5 Mentor/Probe todo : 13:23 ([[2007.10.10#2]]) TODO 1. add all
absolutely necessary features so that I can conveniently work on
LaTeX/Python/Vim/RTF/Markdown/ReST/HTML items.
- ignored words : find corpus - right now in text file , in future maybe in sqlite database with cache option ??
- split by sentence . split by other
 1b. implement all other features which I thought of to have some design ideas
-- all classes, options etc.

2. clean sources and docs so that I can publish them in google hosting
import utlities I use from misc to utils (but only those I use , anyway a trimmed up version)

have a setup py script for building exe files and installer for installing
 
initial version to googlehosting mentor  in svn
initial pre-release for people to download
to have full process
then focus on feedback -> work with the prototypes on Latex, Vim, Python, Markup languages, Qt etc. , Parsing
and other collecting info, tip, idea
-> see other programs how they look like
-> get info from people
then make redesign , rewrite and publish it and advertise it
maybe i will get some feedback ??
right now probe only
feedback from docs, working with




.#4 Mentor workflow 17:21 ([[2007.10.09#1]])
 - have a draft tree for working on many branches on different stuff with quick
 commits every now and then
  and move back and forth between branches

 - have official tree to which I send patches and which is synchronized with
   other
   the patches are fully described so that I can later get info about the
   project

.#3 Mentor Parsing: 16:45 ([[2007.10.08#3]])
work with different python and not python parsing engines:
PyParsing, ANTLR and others
try to write my own (HTML, XML, Lisp, Python etc.)

.#2 Mentor/Probe: 17:59 ([[2007.10.05#9]])
how to ask for a group?
listing of options
.e.g four groups used sync-start , sync-end etc.

.#1 Vim Probe: 16:54 ([[2007.10.05#8]])
 to get round problem of unescaped chars in highligting :

 \command may be ignored if not one of the known commands
 but what about those defined by myself ??

 improve highlighting :
